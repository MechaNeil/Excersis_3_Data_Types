Good day, Neil, bro! Here's a sample **README.md** file for your Student Management System project. This file outlines the project, its structure, features, and instructions on how to compile and run the project.

# Student Management System

A basic Java-based Student Management System that allows users to create classes, add students, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. This project uses a modular file structure to separate different concerns (models, services, utilities) for better organization and scalability.

## File Structure

```
StudentManagementSystem/
└── src/
    ├── Main.java
    ├── models/
    │   ├── Student.java
    │   └── SchoolClass.java
    ├── services/
    │   └── ClassService.java
    └── utils/
        └── FileUtil.java
```

## Features

- **Create Classes:** Easily create new classes.
- **Student Management:** Add, update, display, and remove students from classes.
- **Grade Calculation:** Compute individual student averages and overall class average.
- **Data Persistence:** Save and load classes and student data using file serialization.
- **Number-Based Navigation:** Select classes via numbered menu options to minimize input errors.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- A command-line interface or an IDE like Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA for compiling and running the project.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt and navigate to the `src` folder:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/StudentManagementSystem/src
   ```

2. **Compile all Java files:**

   ```bash
   javac Main.java models/*.java services/*.java utils/*.java
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## Usage

When you run the application, you'll see a menu with options like:

```
1. Create a new class
2. Add a student to a class
3. Display all classes
4. Display students in a class
5. Update student details
6. Remove a student from a class
7. Display class average grade
8. Save and Exit
```

For example, when choosing option **4**, you'll be prompted to select a class from a numbered list (e.g., "1. Mathematics"). Just enter the number corresponding to the desired class to view its students.
